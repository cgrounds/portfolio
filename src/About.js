                After graduating from Indiana University in 2010, I set sail to the west coast. For the 6 months I was in California, I interned for a marketing department, collaborating with Quicksilver for the 2010 Point Mugu Surf contest. Shortly after the internship, I moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany where I hit the slopes and traveled around Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa for 13 months. Throughout the past 5 years, I have been between Austin, New York and Bali honing in on making my hobbies and interests a luctrative career path.  While in New York and Austin, I worked for a line of Ralph Lauren called RRL, which ultimately lead me to landing a job with Lilla Lane in Bali, Indonesia.  While at Lilla Lane, I ran operations for three boutiques in Bali and one in Singapore.  I also helped rebuild and rebrand the company, creating an entirely new website and designing, planning and constructing a store in Singapore.  Before leaving Bali, I designed and produced a collection of high-end teak furniture, which I have imported back to Texas and am in the early learning processes of building an import/export business.
