For the 6 months I was in California, I interned for a marketing department, collaborating with Quicksilver for the 2010 Point Mugu Surf contest. Shortly after the internship, I moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany where I hit the slopes and traveled around Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa for 13 months. Throughout the past 5 years, I have been between Austin, New York and Bali honing in on making my hobbies and interests a luctrative career path.  While in New York and Austin, I worked for a line of Ralph Lauren called RRL, which ultimately lead me to landing a job with Lilla Lane in Bali, Indonesia.  While at Lilla Lane, I ran operations for three boutiques in Bali and one in Singapore.  I also helped rebuild and rebrand the company, creating an entirely new website and designing, planning and constructing a store in Singapore.

For the 6 months I was in California, I interned for a marketing department, collaborating with Quicksilver for the 2010 Point Mugu Surf contest. Shortly after the internship, I moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany where I hit the slopes and traveled around Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa for 13 months. Throughout the past 5 years, I have been between Austin, New York and Bali honing in on making my hobbies and interests a luctrative career path.  While in New York and Austin, I worked for a line of Ralph Lauren called RRL, which ultimately lead me to landing a job with Lilla Lane in Bali, Indonesia.  While at Lilla Lane, I ran operations for three boutiques in Bali and one in Singapore.  I also helped rebuild and rebrand the company, creating an entirely new website and designing, planning and constructing a store in Singapore.  Before leaving Bali, I designed and produced a collection of high-end teak furniture, which I have imported back to Texas and am in the early learning processes of building an import/export business.\n              </p>\n        </div>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/About.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './CSS/App.css';\n// import Home from './Home.js';\n// import Contact from './Contact.js';\n// // import Shop from './Shop.js';\n// import About from './About.js';\n// import Portfolio from './Portfolio.js';\n// import Resume from './Resume.js';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  // var scope = getElementsByClassName('kaleid_cont')\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n\n      <aside>\n          <Link to=\"/\"activeClassName=\"home\">Home</Link>\n          <br />\n          <Link to=\"/contact\"activeClassName=\"active\">Contact</Link>\n          <br />\n          {/* <Link to=\"/shop\"activeClassName=\"active\">Shop</Link>\n          <br /> */}\n          <Link to=\"/about\"activeClassName=\"active\">About</Link>\n          <br />\n          <Link to=\"/portfolio\"activeClassName=\"active\">Portfolio</Link>\n          <br />\n          <Link to=\"/resume\"activeClassName=\"active\">Resume</Link>\n        {this.props.children}\n        </aside>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/App.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Contact extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <div className=\"nav\" id=\"contact\">\n          <h2 id=\"contactHeader\">contact</h2>\n          <h3>\n            usa 1.812.798.2406\n            <br />\n            bali +62.812.3636.8255\n            <br />\n          </h3>\n            <a id=\"email\" href=\"mailto:clintgrounds@gmail.com\">clintgrounds@gmail.com</a>\n            <br />\n            <div id=\"socialMedia\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clintgrounds\">\n            <img src={require('../public/images/facebook.png')} role=\"presentation\"/>\n            </a>\n\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/clintgrounds\">\n            <img src={require('../public/images/linkedin.png')} role=\"presentation\"/></a>\n\n            <a href=\"http://instagram.com/clinstagramed\"><img src={require('../public/images/instagram.png')} role=\"presentation\"/></a>\n\n            <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/125505429\">\n            <img src={require('../public/images/spotify.png')} role=\"presentation\"/></a>\n            </div>\n\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Contact;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/Contact.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Home extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <div>\n          <h3 id=\"home\">C L I N T G R O U N D S</h3>\n          <hr />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/Home.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\n\nexport default (props) => (\n  <h1> 404...
